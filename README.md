## Playing the Game

## Phase 1

The game started out with 4 suns appearing as items to give you points for touching, and 1 dementor chasing you. If the dementor came in contact with you, you would lose points while it was touching you.

## Phase 2

To give the game levels, it was decided to give a count down of 1 minute for each level. To move up a level you would need collect 10,000 points within that minute.
