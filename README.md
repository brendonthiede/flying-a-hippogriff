# Flying a Hippogriff

## Playing the Game

You can find the game here: [Flying a Hippogriff](https://brendonthiede.github.io/flying-a-hippogriff/index.html)

## Phase 1

The game started out with 4 suns appearing as items to give you points for touching, and 1 dementor chasing you. If the dementor came in contact with you, you would lose points while it was touching you.

## Phase 2

To give the game levels, it was decided to give a count down of 1 minute for each level. To move up a level you would need collect 1,000 points within that minute, otherwise the game will be over.

## Phase 3

Add clouds to the background to make the game look better.

## Phase 4

Make levels harder as you move up. Options for making it harder:

* Add more dementors
* Make the dementors faster
* Require more points per level
* Making you go slower

## Phase 5

Add special power boosts, for example, a patronus to blow away the dementors temporarily, or "illusion hippogriffs" to act as a diversion for the dementors.
